1
00:00:09,844 --> 00:00:13,097
Wait, what’s that? Do I hear something
coming down the chimney?

2
00:00:15,183 --> 00:00:18,269
Rick Santa-chez here with gifts
from across the multiverse!

3
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:19,353
-Yes.
-Oh my god.

4
00:00:19,437 --> 00:00:22,940
For Jerry, an extradimensional version
of Miracle on 34th Street.

5
00:00:23,024 --> 00:00:26,569
Two hours longer! They fixed
my only problem with it!

6
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:28,738
For Beth, a framed photo of the two of us

7
00:00:28,821 --> 00:00:31,199
from a universe where she
wasn’t murdered as a child.

8
00:00:31,282 --> 00:00:33,576
-Oh my God. Dad.
-And for Space Beth,

9
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:36,162
he same thing because we,
we don’t know which of you is real.

10
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:37,872
I am also touched.

11
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:39,332
Summer, ch-check your Venmo.

12
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:43,795
-Money? How did you know?
-You’re seventeen.

13
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:46,422
And last but not least,
for my number one number two.

14
00:00:46,506 --> 00:00:49,509
Morty you asked for this a long,
long time ago and I finally went

15
00:00:49,592 --> 00:00:52,428
far, far away enough to get it
since shipping would have killed me.

16
00:00:52,512 --> 00:00:54,847
You didn’t! No fucking way.

17
00:00:54,931 --> 00:00:56,182
-No fucking way.
-No fucking way.

18
00:00:56,265 --> 00:00:58,851
-Does it make the noises?
-Of course it makes the noises.

19
00:00:58,935 --> 00:01:00,812
-that’s like half the fun.
-Awesome!

20
00:01:00,895 --> 00:01:02,313
Do not turn that on!

21
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:05,358
Don’t worry. Morty’s only going to
use this very honorable weapon

22
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:07,944
in designated Jedi zones like
the garage right now.

23
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:17,245
Holy crap. I hate to say it but I
wish there was something to attack.

24
00:01:17,328 --> 00:01:19,539
Yeah it’s too bad nobody bought
a cart a fruit!

25
00:01:19,622 --> 00:01:21,624
You beautiful son of a bitch!

26
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:26,838
Grapefruit! Mango! Papaya! Watermelon!
A second papaya! Another watermelon!

27
00:01:26,921 --> 00:01:28,047
-Strike me down.
-What?

28
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,258
-Strike me down.
-I’m not striking you down.

29
00:01:30,341 --> 00:01:33,553
Strike me down Morty! I’ll, I’ll become
a pile of clothes like that old guy!

30
00:01:33,636 --> 00:01:35,012
But you'll die, you’re drunk.

31
00:01:35,096 --> 00:01:36,722
-Here, I’ll, I’ll do it myself.
-No!

32
00:01:39,058 --> 00:01:43,396
Wow, you did it! Just like Obi Wan.
Rick? You can come out now.

33
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:47,942
I’m serious. Did you like, become
your clothes? Are you T-shirt Rick now?

34
00:01:48,526 --> 00:01:49,819
Over here, buttfart.

35
00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:51,904
-That was awesome!
-Right?

36
00:01:51,988 --> 00:01:54,407
Rick, you know you’ve been so
great the last couple months,

37
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:57,076
the family’s so happy,
I’m really grateful.

38
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:59,954
Thanks kid, but less talk
more melon slaying! Heads up!

39
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:09,005
-Oh shit shit shit. Open it, Rick!
-Let me do it! Get up, get fucking move!

40
00:02:09,088 --> 00:02:11,215
Hurry! Hurry!

41
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:15,011
You dropped it perfectly vertical, Morty!
Perfectly fucking vertical!

42
00:02:15,094 --> 00:02:17,263
-I got it, I got it
-Ah, shi...

43
00:02:19,098 --> 00:02:20,433
-Shit.
-Elevator! Elevator!

44
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:23,561
-We gotta get ahead of it! Level ten?
-No no no, fifteen!

45
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:31,319
Wait, we live over a cool sushi spot?

46
00:02:31,402 --> 00:02:33,988
-Irasshaimase!
-Domo. Domo. Not now though.

47
00:02:34,614 --> 00:02:36,449
Okay, we overshot it.
Good problem to have.

48
00:02:36,908 --> 00:02:37,950
Still doing the eel roll?

49
00:02:38,034 --> 00:02:40,119
-I told you we shoulda gone to ten!
-No, Morty, not ten!

50
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:42,997
Morty, wait, wait, wait!

51
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:46,292
What the fuck?

52
00:02:48,252 --> 00:02:52,173
-Rick?
-You dumb fucking robot. You had one job!

53
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:53,925
Hey, that job is to be a good Grandpa,

54
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:56,010
-I go where the kid goes.
-Don’t touch me!

55
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:58,638
How long have I...
You said you weren’t a robot!

56
00:02:58,721 --> 00:03:00,139
It killed me to lie to you, Morty!

57
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:02,600
But it would have literally
killed me not to lie to you.

58
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:04,477
Betrayal! Betrayal on all sides!

59
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,480
Don’t overreact, Morty. I replaced myself
towards the beginning of that

60
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:08,981
whole Knights of the Sun thing.

61
00:03:09,065 --> 00:03:12,068
I’m no good to anybody until
I resolve this arch nemesis crap.

62
00:03:12,151 --> 00:03:14,153
You’re still hunting the guy
who killed your wife?

63
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:17,156
You don’t have to rub it in, Morty,
that’s why I removed myself.

64
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:20,576
I’ve become the thing I hate.
It’s like a Netflix drama down here,

65
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:24,205
and I don’t mean an accidentally good one,
I mean a regular-ass Netflix drama.

66
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,289
I did you a favor.

67
00:03:29,794 --> 00:03:32,171
You gave him a fuckin’
lightsaber for Christmas?

68
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:34,966
It’s almost like someone designed me
to be twenty-two percent

69
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:36,300
-more thoughtful than you.
-Alright, that’s it,

70
00:03:36,384 --> 00:03:37,927
-I’m shutting you down
-Don’t you dare.

71
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,012
You’ve done enough.
The whole family, Rick.

72
00:03:40,096 --> 00:03:42,723
-Everybody loves this thing.
-Oh, good.

73
00:03:42,807 --> 00:03:46,560
By the way, your lightsaber’s probably run
out of sub-basement by now, so, congrats.

74
00:03:46,936 --> 00:03:47,979
Unbelievable.

75
00:03:49,522 --> 00:03:50,690
I can’t believe you tricked us

76
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:52,274
-into loving you!
-Not because I like it,

77
00:03:52,358 --> 00:03:55,736
because it’s my job! But thank
god I don’t have to do it anymore.

78
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,697
The fuck you don’t. It’s Christmas!

79
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,740
Get up there and trick everyone
into loving you more!

80
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:02,410
Let’s get our miracle on.

81
00:04:03,035 --> 00:04:06,205
-Speaking of miracles.
-What, bored of your toy already?

82
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:08,874
Just excited to spend time with my family.

83
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:11,460
You know me and Morty,
we’re all about those streets.

84
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,380
Would ya look at this! New York City!

85
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:16,465
Who woulda thought it had
so many streets?

86
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:21,178
And avenues too. Oh Gosh! Hey, sir!
Sir, have you seen any miracles?

87
00:04:21,262 --> 00:04:23,305
My little girl, she’s sick
and she needs a miracle.

88
00:04:24,265 --> 00:04:26,684
The Presidential blackhawk
is landing on the lawn.

89
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:27,727
I’ll get rid of him.

90
00:04:29,562 --> 00:04:32,648
-You got something to tell me, Morty?
-Merry Christmas?

91
00:04:32,732 --> 00:04:35,276
Who dropped a lightsaber
perfectly fucking vertical?

92
00:04:36,652 --> 00:04:39,447
Guess what, numb nuts,
it’s a mile deep and still going.

93
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:40,781
You know what’s
in the hilt of that thing?

94
00:04:40,865 --> 00:04:42,783
-Kyber Crystals.
-Okay, nerd.

95
00:04:43,117 --> 00:04:44,952
Whatever it is, when it hits the core,

96
00:04:45,036 --> 00:04:47,329
it’s gonna cause a chain
reaction that destroys the Earth.

97
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:49,290
-It is?
-Why are you still playing wth

98
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:51,250
laser swords anyway? You’re fourteen.

99
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:53,586
You know all that Star
Wars shit is silly, right?

100
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:57,465
Lucas promised a new trilogy for decades,
then when he delivered fans turned on him

101
00:04:57,548 --> 00:04:59,925
and started giving any knucklehead
with nerd cred a shot

102
00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:03,637
and churned out these irredeemable
cash grabs. Half pretend to be satisfied,

103
00:05:03,721 --> 00:05:05,931
half shit on it and in the end
no one’s happy.

104
00:05:06,015 --> 00:05:07,349
Do you know why, Morty?

105
00:05:07,433 --> 00:05:10,561
Because when you start with a turd,
you end with a turd.

106
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:13,689
Why you crying? Where’s Rick?

107
00:05:15,316 --> 00:05:20,446
He’s busy, and I hate him, and I lost my
lightsaber and now it might destroy Earth

108
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:23,365
and you’re unloading all this Gen X
hatred on me for even wanting one

109
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:26,702
-and it’s the worst Christmas ever!
-Okay, Morty, Morty.

110
00:05:26,786 --> 00:05:28,954
I shouldn’t have talked to
you like you’re a UN official.

111
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:32,124
Let’s get your embarrassing ass lightsaber
back so you can swing it around

112
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:33,167
instead of kissing girls.

113
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:37,755
You found me! Found me!
Found me!

114
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:47,807
-Security breach.
-What the hell?

115
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,935
-Unauthorized presence.
-What the fuck Morty?

116
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:56,232
This morning, a real life version
of George Lucas’s trademarked lightsaber

117
00:05:56,315 --> 00:05:59,527
was dropped point down and is whomp
whomping its way to the core of the Earth

118
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:01,237
where it will blow us all up.

119
00:06:03,656 --> 00:06:07,201
Touch my shit and die. That’s not a threat
from me, that’s how advanced my shit is.

120
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:10,871
Impressive lair, Sanchez. Got about
six hundred thousand permits?

121
00:06:10,955 --> 00:06:13,499
If I wanted the government in my
house I’d buy an Alexa!

122
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:16,001
-I invited him in, Rick.
-Yeah, well, they can leave.

123
00:06:16,085 --> 00:06:18,170
-I’ll destroy it.
-We’re gonna retrieve it.

124
00:06:18,254 --> 00:06:20,923
-Well that’s stupid.
-What kind of grandfather are you?

125
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:22,466
It’s Christmas for God’s sake,

126
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:25,010
and you look like Phil Spector
wiped his ass with Randy Quaid.

127
00:06:25,094 --> 00:06:27,054
If you’re gonna help,
help, otherwise step aside.

128
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:29,014
Merry Christmas to me.

129
00:06:29,098 --> 00:06:30,850
-Merry Christmas to me!
-To me!

130
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:33,686
Anyhoo, I’m no expert but
it seems we’ve gotta...

131
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:36,856
a certain amount of time
to build a big drill ship.

132
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:37,940
A big drill ship?

133
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:40,151
That’s some pretty loud
stepping aside you’re doing.

134
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:42,736
-Just let me destroy the thing!
-You’ve destroyed enough!

135
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:48,868
Oh, I see someone found my
Told-ya so Dispenser.

136
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:54,206
Oh my god, look at all these streets!
We got 34th street! 35th street!

137
00:06:54,290 --> 00:07:00,296
36th street coming too! It’s a miracle!
We got miracles on 37th street!

138
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:04,133
38th, and don’t even get
me started on the Avenues!

139
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:05,676
I can’t believe they cut this!

140
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:08,888
Dad. You’ve been so great lately.

141
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:12,433
I’m almost afraid it’s not real.
You’re not a robot, are you?

142
00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:15,853
Put it this way, honey.
If I am, I’m a robot

143
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:18,564
programmed to love you very, very much.

144
00:07:22,026 --> 00:07:24,570
Will this drill down fast enough
to get under the lightsaber?

145
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:27,114
Yep. It will be under the lightsaber
in one hour, because the...

146
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:30,242
Wait, it’s lower now.
Oh, right, it’s moving.

147
00:07:30,326 --> 00:07:32,369
You fucking idiot. Get out of here!

148
00:07:32,453 --> 00:07:34,872
Good luck finding
a good scientist on Christmas!

149
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:37,416
I’m President of the United
Assholes.

150
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:40,753
All right, genius, I give you permission

151
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:43,172
-to make our drill ship faster.
-I’m not touching that thing.

152
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:46,634
I’ll get neurotypical cooties, I have
son-in-laws more imaginative

153
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:50,095
-Alright, just destroy the lightsaber!
-Thought you’d never ask.

154
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:51,430
Not true, I knew you’d ask.

155
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:53,766
-What is that?
-A second lightsaber

156
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:56,393
with an AI controlled gyroscopic rocket
in the hilt.

157
00:07:56,477 --> 00:07:59,021
-You had a lightsaber?
-Oh did you want one?

158
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:01,440
What a terrible gift that would have made.

159
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:04,777
-Vertisaber, state your prime directive.
-To stay vertical.

160
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,820
-Then show ‘em how it’s done.
-Affirmative.

161
00:08:08,781 --> 00:08:10,115
-Yeah!
-America!

162
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:16,497
-Maintain verticality, Vertisaber.
-Affirmative.

163
00:08:17,206 --> 00:08:18,874
Alright, looking good. Stay on target.

164
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:22,836
Progress report.

165
00:08:24,255 --> 00:08:27,466
-Vertisaber, do you copy?
-Do I have to respond every time?

166
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:30,261
-Excuse me?
-I’m designed to stay perfectly vertical,

167
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:33,180
not to give constant affirmation,
you do your job I’ll do mine.

168
00:08:33,264 --> 00:08:34,515
-I control you!
-Okay,

169
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:37,268
I’ll just turn off my brain
and you can do that, bye!

170
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:39,603
Fucking kidding me? Shit!

171
00:08:40,062 --> 00:08:41,105
Trajectory’s drifting, sir.

172
00:08:41,689 --> 00:08:44,149
-Where is it coming out?
-Looks like Italy, sir.

173
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:49,029
Okay, that coulda been worse.

174
00:08:55,244 --> 00:08:58,455
Well, that is definitely not Amore.

175
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:01,041
-Way to show us how it’s done, Rick.
-Whatever.

176
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:03,502
-Italian Prime Minister on line one.
-Put him on hold.

177
00:09:03,836 --> 00:09:06,171
We can pin this on the Saudis.
This is something they’d do.

178
00:09:06,964 --> 00:09:08,090
They may as well have done it.

179
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:10,092
They did do it.

180
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:13,721
Oh, there’s another miracle at the
end of the intersection

181
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:17,224
of four hundred and first boulevard
and seven thousand street!

182
00:09:17,308 --> 00:09:21,687
-That’s a miracle per block so far.
-Okay even I’m nearing my limit.

183
00:09:22,104 --> 00:09:23,397
Let’s play a Christmas game!

184
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,193
Have you guys ever played
“Are You a Robot?”

185
00:09:28,277 --> 00:09:31,447
Each person here has to decide
whether or not t-they’re a robot.

186
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:32,906
-Ooh I like that.
-Yes, yes, yes.

187
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:35,034
But don’t say it out loud.
Because if you’re a robot,

188
00:09:35,117 --> 00:09:37,202
you’re not allowed to say
you are, that’s the rule.

189
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:39,955
That’s the horrible, painful thing
about being a robot.

190
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:42,708
But you do have to answer
everyone’s questions.

191
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,878
And it’s their jobs to decide whether
you are or aren’t a robot because,

192
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:48,714
because if you are a robot you can’t
say! You’re not allowed to say at all.

193
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:51,383
I’ll go first! Question?

194
00:09:52,885 --> 00:09:55,679
-Are you a robot? Can I just ask that?
-You can!

195
00:09:55,763 --> 00:09:58,015
But don’t forget that
if i am i have to lie

196
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:01,060
even though i don’t want to.
More questions?

197
00:10:01,143 --> 00:10:03,395
-Can you feel things?
-Oh fuck yes! Yes!

198
00:10:03,479 --> 00:10:06,482
That’s the problem! If I’m a robot,
which I’m not,

199
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:10,319
don’t forget I have to say that
but yes, yes, I feel so much,

200
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:14,073
I’m filled with love for certain
people, but also filled with shame

201
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:16,200
If I’m programmed to deceive them,

202
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:18,410
-but that’s a big if!
-What’s your skeleton made of?

203
00:10:18,494 --> 00:10:19,411
Titanium!

204
00:10:19,495 --> 00:10:21,163
-You’re, you’re a robot!
-Yes!

205
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:24,917
No! But that’s what a robot would say!
So you get the idea!

206
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,293
Suck it bitches!

207
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:29,171
This is fun! I’ve always been
afraid to let my guard down

208
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:30,881
and just have stupid family fun like this

209
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:33,675
but Grandpa Rick is making me
learn to be vulnerable!

210
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:34,760
-Me too!
-Right on!

211
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:42,142
Alright. Your derivative drill ship
is now faster than a lightsaber.

212
00:10:42,226 --> 00:10:45,020
-Morty, you want front or back?
-Who says the two of us are going?

213
00:10:45,104 --> 00:10:47,731
-You didn’t even want to...
-Oh for fuck’s sake, bye,

214
00:10:47,815 --> 00:10:49,274
good luck, don’t blow up my planet

215
00:10:49,358 --> 00:10:51,527
You act like you’re the one that
got stabbed in the back.

216
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:53,153
Because I am the one, Morty.

217
00:10:53,237 --> 00:10:55,864
You wanna know why I replaced
myself in the beginning of that stupid

218
00:10:55,948 --> 00:10:58,784
Knights of the Sun thing? I said
don’t take the fucking sword

219
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:00,285
and you were like “whatever”

220
00:11:00,369 --> 00:11:03,163
like I’m our neighbor Gene or
David Arquette or something.

221
00:11:03,247 --> 00:11:05,916
You called me boring.
I’ve become dog shit to you.

222
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,794
That’s what happens when you let
people in and they stop respecting you,

223
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:11,964
they touch your shit, they screw
things up, they kill your fucking family.

224
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:14,591
Go ahead. Trust him. You’re going
to learn the same fucking thing.

225
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:20,180
I... am not going to
kill your family, Morty.

226
00:11:20,806 --> 00:11:21,723
That means a lot.

227
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:29,189
In case this goes south,
any last words, Morty?

228
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:31,191
I’ve never been old enough
to vote, Mr. President,

229
00:11:31,275 --> 00:11:33,902
-but when I am, I’ll vote for you.
-Thanks, Morty.

230
00:11:33,986 --> 00:11:36,864
Every vote counts. If you want I can
have them legally change your age.

231
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:39,658
No, I’m not in any hurry to
get into that shit show.

232
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:43,954
Approaching the lightsaber in T minus,
shit, now, T-minus NOW!

233
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:46,498
Sorry! I missed countdown day
at the academy.

234
00:11:46,582 --> 00:11:47,624
Now or never, Morty!

235
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,505
-There it is!
-Reverse the jets!

236
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:56,258
I got this!

237
00:11:58,844 --> 00:12:00,554
No... I do!

238
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:04,349
Morty, you magnificent little bastard!
Let’s get this thing topside.

239
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,522
May the force be with me!

240
00:12:10,606 --> 00:12:14,193
-I think you mean with me.
-What? You hate Star Wars.

241
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:18,030
I was your age when this shit was
in theaters. This franchise raised me.

242
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:21,617
Trained me, taught me good from evil,
made having a bad father empowering.

243
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:25,954
And when that third movie got all
muppety, something in me began to rot,

244
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:30,209
but make no mistake, child.
I own Star Wars. Not you.

245
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:34,046
Not that bubble throat pompadour fuck,
not some Mickey Mouse shit machine,

246
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:36,590
they didn’t pay the price
with their souls. I did.

247
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:37,925
I earned this. Not you.

248
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:43,472
-America! Transform and roll out.
-Bastard!

249
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:51,563
Rick. I would be honored if you
would carve the ham this year.

250
00:12:52,314 --> 00:12:53,899
-Dad, that’s...
-Unheard of?

251
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:55,150
You’re quite right, Summer.

252
00:12:55,234 --> 00:12:59,446
It’s my way of saying I see
your mom’s father as my father too.

253
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:02,282
Jerry, w-w-why don’t you cut it?

254
00:13:02,658 --> 00:13:04,243
Geez, Dad, what the hell are you doing?

255
00:13:04,326 --> 00:13:07,246
He’s like adopting you into his
biological family, Grandpa.

256
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:09,998
Morty, I am sure glad to see you.

257
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:13,085
-Ready to tag your old grandpa back in?
-You’re not my grandpa,

258
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:14,586
you’re a fucking robot.

259
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:23,428
Finally.

260
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:28,392
The First Noel

261
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:33,730
The Angels did say

262
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:39,570
was to certain poor shepherds

263
00:13:39,945 --> 00:13:44,616
in fields as they lay.

264
00:13:47,536 --> 00:13:49,913
Okay, okay, okay.

265
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:58,297
-Summer do you have any drugs?
-Are you serious?

266
00:13:58,630 --> 00:13:59,590
I guess not.

267
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:01,967
I’m just glad I’m not the one
that ruined Christmas

268
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,219
-People of Earth.
-That’s never good.

269
00:14:04,303 --> 00:14:06,888
I’m not here to play the blame game
but Morty Smith

270
00:14:06,972 --> 00:14:09,349
got a lightsaber for Christmas,
dropped it, and it’s now

271
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:12,144
heading for the Earth’s core again,
I mean for the first time.

272
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:13,895
Son of a bitch! He played with it!

273
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:16,732
If it does reach the core,
it will blow all of you up.

274
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:20,485
I mean all of us up.
But don’t abandon hope.

275
00:14:20,569 --> 00:14:24,364
We’re doing everything we can to
stop it and only if that fails

276
00:14:24,448 --> 00:14:26,325
will we launch the White House
into space...

277
00:14:28,452 --> 00:14:30,912
Welp, I’m busted.
Clearly in space already.

278
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:32,831
-You did ruin Christmas.
-Nuh-uh!

279
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:36,543
He stole my lightsaber and must’ve
dropped it! A second time!

280
00:14:36,627 --> 00:14:39,171
Does that mean you stopped it a
first time? How?

281
00:14:39,254 --> 00:14:42,507
-A drill ship.
-A drill ship? Awesome.

282
00:14:42,591 --> 00:14:44,509
It was, but the government
took it with them.

283
00:14:44,593 --> 00:14:46,595
Then we lean on the only
asshole smart enough to make

284
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:49,306
-another one in this tight a window.
-But Rick’s gone.

285
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,224
And I’m not sure he’s ever coming back.

286
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,685
Then let’s settle for the next best thing.

287
00:14:55,354 --> 00:14:58,106
Oh fuck, just let me die! Turn me off.

288
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:01,109
Not that I can be turned off
because I’m obviously not a robot!

289
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:25,384
Fuck yeah! I got you.

290
00:15:26,802 --> 00:15:28,095
Okay, I can, I can work with that.

291
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,229
What do youmean the White House chef
was grocery shopping?

292
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:41,233
Well do you know how to make an egg?
You do? Everyone does?

293
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:45,779
Good news, sir. The lightsaber was
intercepted before it hit the core!

294
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:49,908
Alright, here we go! I don’t suppose
you could send it up here.

295
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:53,537
-Who intercepted it anyway?
-That’s the bad news.

296
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,081
That is bad news.

297
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:03,880
- Hey, Mister P. Drop something?
-Morty.

298
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:07,426
I see you and Rick patched
things up, that’s nice.

299
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:09,302
No, the real Rick and I have
never been worse

300
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:12,389
thanks to that wedge you drove
between us just to get that lightsaber!

301
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:16,017
Yeah, well, looks like you got it back.
Your journey is complete.

302
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:18,311
-As a nerd!
-You’re the nerd!

303
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:21,606
You can’t say all that crazy shit about
Star Wars and then act like you’re cool!

304
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:24,526
Oh really, would a person who
wasn’t cool have one of these?

305
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:26,403
I think so?

306
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,029
Slowly closing door, slide!

307
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:31,491
Oh no I’m not gonna make it.

308
00:16:31,867 --> 00:16:36,204
What a shame to be put
out of my misery again. Aw man.

309
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:44,296
What the hell? Was this always
part of the White House?

310
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:46,131
Carter built it with his own two hands.

311
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:49,968
Reagan tried to destroy it.
George W added kegs to the cantina.

312
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:53,597
But only I saw its true value.

313
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,725
Mister President. You need to come
home and tell the people the truth.

314
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:59,436
The fuck I do. Droids, get that saber!

315
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:03,899
Give it a minute. Usually comes out
on the fourth try.

316
00:17:04,775 --> 00:17:09,988
Alright, here we go. Look at ‘em.
lightsaber hands! Tell me that’s not cool!

317
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:13,617
It’s not! I always wanted to fight
with a lightsaber, but not like this.

318
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,203
-You ruined it!
-Disney ruined it!

319
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:19,164
You think I want thirty low-rent
tv series with bad CGI?

320
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:22,292
They film everything on that
one big green screen!

321
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,002
Like you’ve got better ideas.

322
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:28,924
I’ve got a million! Here’s one:
a robot with lightsabers for eyes!

323
00:17:37,516 --> 00:17:39,017
Goddamnit, he can’t see!

324
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:46,066
It was a good idea otherwise.
I... admit it, you were intimidated!

325
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,319
Now, Morty...

326
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:56,952
C’mon, put down the lightsaber
gatling gun. We had our fun, right?

327
00:17:58,036 --> 00:17:59,371
Star Wars rules say

328
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:02,541
-you have to forgive me.
-I’m done with that and I’m done with you!

329
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:05,085
-Morty, no!
-Rickbot!

330
00:18:05,961 --> 00:18:07,379
He sacrificed his life for me!

331
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:10,215
Yeah don’t be too touched,
he’s actively trying to die.

332
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:13,635
It’s okay, it doesn’t hurt.

333
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:18,223
Oh god, they’re sliding, Morty!
They’re sliding! They’re sliding!

334
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:23,186
The First Noel

335
00:18:23,562 --> 00:18:27,732
-the Angels did say.
-Perfectly fucking vertical.

336
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:36,908
Save yourself, Morty!
Rick can build another me.

337
00:18:36,992 --> 00:18:39,244
If I was a robot, which I’m not.

338
00:18:39,661 --> 00:18:43,331
I don’t want another you. No!

339
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:49,963
Rick? You came to help!

340
00:18:50,297 --> 00:18:51,631
Better tend to your lil toaster.

341
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:55,093
I’m coughing up oil, Morty.

342
00:18:55,177 --> 00:18:59,264
Oh Rickbot, I never should’ve pushed
you away. You were, you were so great.

343
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:00,932
Of course I’m great, I’m Rick.

344
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,936
Rick literally built me to
make you happy, Morty.

345
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,856
Anything I do is technically
something Rick did.

346
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:12,485
But maybe he can do a little more himself.

347
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:14,321
God, how long do you take to die?

348
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:16,573
Goodbye Morty.

349
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:23,580
Jesus, Rick.

350
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:27,459
I guess this is a bad time to
ask for a new White House?

351
00:19:29,461 --> 00:19:31,046
Morty, would you mind calling me an Uber?

352
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:35,550
Right, well... Merry Christmas.

353
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:39,304
I guess I’ll go watch a guy scream
about streets with the family.

354
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:41,848
-Also, you need to shower.
-Hey.

355
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:45,852
Maybe the robot’s right, I should
have included you in my shit.

356
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:48,647
You can help me if you want.

357
00:19:53,235 --> 00:19:56,154
Wow, are those all the places
Rick Prime could be?

358
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:58,990
I wish, Morty. It’s all the places he is.

359
00:19:59,074 --> 00:20:01,326
-Ah geez.
-Welcome to my darkness.

360
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:03,954
I spent my life hunting this guy, Morty!

361
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:07,832
This is the closest I’ve ever been to
catching “Rick Prime”, it’s impossible!

362
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:11,836
He’s an incredibly crafty piece of shit.
Hunting him destroyed me, Morty!

363
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,172
But now we’re gonna do it together!
You and me!

364
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:17,509
It’s gonna take over your life, Morty!
Rick and Morty Season 7,

365
00:20:17,592 --> 00:20:20,595
hunting my nemesis! Maybe trying to
stay healthy while doing it!

366
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:23,848
Juggling plates! And not every episode,
Morty! It could be all happening

367
00:20:23,932 --> 00:20:26,726
in the background! Who knows?
You know, no one will! Except us!

368
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:29,396
It’s the most painful shit I’ve
ever had to deal with

369
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:32,315
and I’m fucking bringing you into it.
Because you asked for it, Morty!

370
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:33,483
You and me, Morty!

371
00:21:05,807 --> 00:21:11,312
Ooo-wee! What a season, huh? Rick Prime!
Therapy! And that thing we did with Roy,

372
00:21:11,396 --> 00:21:16,401
remember that? Sorry I wasn’t around,
been busy getting my little poopybutt

373
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:18,653
in shape. Been tonin and bonin!

374
00:21:19,988 --> 00:21:23,533
You- you might think I’m over compensating
for the emptiness after Amy left

375
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:28,580
with Poopy Jr, but my trainer Carl says
the best way to get over a girl is to get

376
00:21:28,663 --> 00:21:31,583
-under a three hundred pound squat.
-Damn right.

377
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,502
Ooooo-wee, that’s the good stuff!

378
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:42,469
Ah sugar, ah sugar, ah sugar, is it bad?
Oh! It seems really bad, isn’t it?

379
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:48,641
Someone call Amy, tell her I need her,
tell her I love her! Not my phone,

380
00:21:48,725 --> 00:21:52,812
she blocked me, use yours.
Ooo-weee... I am broken.
